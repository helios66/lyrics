''Tarja''
A lady with a violin
Playing to the seals
Hearken to the sound
Of calling

''Marco''
Who tied my hands to the wheel
The zodiac turns over me
''Tarja:'' Come to me
Somewhere there my fate revealed
I hear but how will I see?

I tied myself to the wheel
Winds talk to my sails
Not me
''Tarja:'' Come to me
Somewhere there my fate revealed
I hear but how will I see?
