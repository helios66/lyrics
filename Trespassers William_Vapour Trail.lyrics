First you look so strong
Then you fade away
The sun will blind my eyes
I love you anyway

First you fight your smile
I loved you for a while
You are a vapour trail
In a deep blue sky

Tremble with a sigh
Glitter in your eye
You seem to come and go
I never seem to know

And all my time
Is yours as much as mine
We never have enough
Time to show our love
