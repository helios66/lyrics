The principles of lust are easy to understand... 
Do what you feel, feel until the end. 
The principles of lust, are burned in your mind... 
Do what you want, do it until you find love.

The principles of lust are easy to understand... 
Do what you feel, feel until the end. 
The principles of lust, are burned in your mind...
Do what you want, do it until you find love.
