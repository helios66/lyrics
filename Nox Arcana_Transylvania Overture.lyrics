Darkness descends upon the land to wrap the world in night's black embrace. The restless dead stir in their ancient tombs and creatures, born of shadow, rise to quench their savage hungers. Whispers echo from the crypt, beckoning with the promise of dark desire. And those who heed their call are forever lost in the night.
