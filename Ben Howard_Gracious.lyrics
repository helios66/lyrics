How would you know?
When everything around you's changing like the weather,
A big black storm.
And where'd you turn to?
Or hide a ghost, a shadow at the most, would you let me know?
Cause I don't want to,
To trouble your mind with the childish design of how it all should go.
But I love you so,
When it all comes clear, when the wind is settled, I'll be here, you know.

Cause you said ours were the lighthouse towers
The sand upon that place
Darling I'll grow weary, happy still
With just the memory of your face

Gracious goes the ghost of you
And I will never forget the plans and the
Silhouettes you drew here and
Gracious goes the ghost of you
My dear

How would you know?
When everything around you's bruised and battered
Like the cold night storm.
And where would you turn to?
Or hide a ghost, a shadow at the most, would you tell me so?
Cause I, I adore you so
When it all comes clear, the wind is settled, I'll be here, you know.

Cause you said ours were the lighthouse towers
The sand upon that place
Darling I'll grow weary, happy still
With just the memory of your face

Gracious goes the ghost of you
And I will never forget the plans and the
Silhouettes you drew here and
Gracious goes the ghost of you
My dear

Gracious goes the ghost of you
And I will never forget the plans and the
Silhouettes you drew here and
Gracious goes the ghost of you
My dear
