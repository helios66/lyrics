Ooh, oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh ooh

You and I go hard at each other
Like we're going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things
And slamming the door

You and I get so damn dysfunctional
We start keeping score
You and I get sick, yeah
I know that we can't do this no more, yeah

But baby, there you go again
There you go again making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head
Using my head, let it all go

I got you stuck on my body
On my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid
Feeling stupid, crawling back to you

So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I will only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

Try to tell you no
But my body keeps on telling you yes
Try to tell you to stop
But your lipstick got me so out of breath

I'd be waking up in the morning
Probably hating myself
And I'd be waking up
Feeling satisfied but guilty as hell, yeah

But baby, there you go again
There you go again, making me love you
Yeah I stopped using my head
Using my head, let it all go

I got you stuck on my body
On my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid
Feeling stupid, crawling back to you

So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I will only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night
(Ooh, oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Yeah baby, give me one more night
(Ooh, oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Yeah baby, give me one more night
(Ooh, oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Yeah baby, give me one more night

But baby, there you go again
There you go again making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head
Using my head, let it all go

Got you stuck on my body
On my body like a tattoo, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I will only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you for one more night
(Yeah baby give me one more night)

So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I’ll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I’ll only stay with you one more night
