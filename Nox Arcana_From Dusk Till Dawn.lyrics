From dusk till dawn, beware night's call,
For Nightmares rise as shadows fall—
Wolves howl and wail 'neath moonlit skies,
And grim things harken to their cries—
The restless dead and souls forsaken,
From their deathly sleep, awaken—
And things that shun the light of day,
Prowl the night in search of prey—
