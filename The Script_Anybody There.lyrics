My head is saying no
But my heart keeps giving in
So hard to let it go
When it's there under my skin 

Well if this is the face of a sinner
And if heaven was only for winners
Well I don't care -
'Cause I won't know anybody there 

Thought that I'd let it slide
But it's me that's slipping in
Thought that I'd go for a ride
Before this crash I'm dying in 

refrain:
Well if I'm judged on the life I've been living
And if heaven is not soul forgiving
Well I don't care -
'Cause I won't know anybody there
I don't care, 'cause I won't know
Anybody there 

My head is saying no
But my heart keeps giving in
It's so hard to let it go
When it's there under my skin 

refrain:
I don't care, 'cause I won't know
Anybody there 

Is there anybody there? (3x)
