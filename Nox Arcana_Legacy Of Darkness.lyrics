Dementia, horrific delusions, psychotic paranoia, violent sociopathic behaviour... these are but a few of the torments that plague the wretched souls confined within these walls. And though modern science has discovered ways to rationalize and treat certain mental disorders, there are still some extreme cases that defy explanation or cure.

For the essence of evil dwells in the deepest shadows of the mind and the gateway to revelation lies beyond the threshold of madness...
