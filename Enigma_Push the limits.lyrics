Inclination of equator to orbit:
24.936 degrees.

Gravitational escape velocity:
3.121 miles per hour. 

Inclination from Orbit.

Basic instincts, social life.
Paradoxes  side by side.

Don't submit to stupid rules.
Be yourself and not a fool.
Don't accept average habits.
Open your heart and push the limits.
