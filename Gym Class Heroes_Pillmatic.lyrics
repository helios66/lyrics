Pillmatic 
Three Zani's down
I'm poundin' Honey Browns
I'm pillmatic
The OxyContin got my stomach rotten
Pillmatic I swear to God I'm not an addict
But I'm still at it
Goddamn it, I'm pillmatic

Thinking back on when it all started
I found pink hearts in mommy's little pocket book
And took 'em
Poppin' when she wasn't looking
I guess it runs in the family
I'm liable to eat any pill you randomly hand me
Save the greenery
I'm looking for them labels reading
&quot;May cause drowsiness&quot;
&quot;Be careful when operating machinery&quot;
Beautiful pharmaceuticals
Residue in my cuticles
Sniffin' them with a suitable
Wishin' they made 'em chewable

Catch me in the source with five pills next to my name
Like fuck five mics, I want five Vic fame
If killing pain is the name of the game
Then I'm your number one draft pick
Dash quick to the closest medicine cabinet
Kill the whole bottle
Never played the role model position
I'm just livin'
So take two of these and call me in the morning
I'ma take four and finish this 40 cause life's boring

Pillmatic 
Three Zani's down
I'm poundin Honey Browns
I'm pillmatic
The OxyContin got my stomach rotten
Pillmatic I swear to God I'm not an addict
But I'm still at it
Goddamn it, I'm pillmatic

Keep the hydro unless it's Codone behind it
Never have to roam far from home to find it
Writin' fake scripts like my doctor signed it
Till I spelled his last name wrong
This ain't a song for the kids like the last album
Put 'em to bed, go ahead and turn the Valium up
A couple meds to ease the pain of the papercuts
The doctor says slow down maybe later buts
40 milligrams, a 40 and I'm faded
This world is crazy so I stay medicated
Percocet, Ativan, and Klonopin
When my social lights are out
They turn them on again
I'll eat 'em till I'm born again
OxyContin, orange juice and gin
Equals projectile wild style burner on a porcelain

Pillmatic 
Three Zani's down
I'm poundin Honey Browns
I'm pillmatic
The OxyContin got my stomach rotten
Pillmatic I swear to God I'm not an addict
But I'm still at it
Goddamn it, I'm pillmatic
