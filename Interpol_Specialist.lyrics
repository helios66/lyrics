You make me lose my buttons 
Oh yeah, you make me spit
I don't like my clothes anymore 

We're spending time and money 
Yeah, you're colder than yourself 
Now we're moving, now we're taking control                   

You make me lose my buttons 
Oh yeah, you make me spit
I don't like my clothes anymore   

You put me to New Orleans 
Yeah, you put me to the test 
I know what my heart is for 

You reach out for a blanket 
I say girl you've got something
I love how you wear it 

Now we're spending time and money 
Yeah, you're colder than yourself 
Now we're moving, now we're taking control                   

Love will get you down 

My love's a laboratory 
I set all my pets free
So baby, you should sleep with me 

I make trips to the bathroom 
Yeah, my friends all have true grit 
I'm speckled like a leopard  

Put a lid on Shirley Temple
Yeah, you make sleek kills 
Yeah, you travel, you travel 

You park me in your Buick
You sing songs into my lips 
Well I'm speckled like a leopard 
Just like a leopard 

And love will get you down 

I love the way you put me in the big house 
I love the way you put me in the big house 

If I get there early will it be the right time?
Our heaven is just waiting, so put your hand into mine 
If I get too surly will you take that in stride?
Our boat is just there waiting so put that little hand in mine 

And speak when you're spoken of 
Catch up on your sleep girl
When you wear that body glove 
You're acting on initiative 
You're spelling out your love 
You shouldn't be alone in there 
You could be above ground 

All I want is to be the very best for you 
Oh yeah, all I want is to do the very best by you
Oh, this time
There'll be no life of crime
Don't rain on me tonight 

Circle around me now, baby 
It will be okay
'cause we all go downtown sometimes 

Somehow baby, we'll beat this mess 
It's the time, fuck the surface to meet the specialist 

And time away from me will get you down

I love the way you put me in the big house 
I love the way you put me in the big house 

If I get there early will it be the right time?
Our heaven is just waiting, so put your hand into mine 
If I get too surly will you take that in stride?
Our boat is just there waiting so put that little hand in mine 

And speak when you're spoken of 
Catch up on your sleep 
When you wear that body glove 
You're acting on initiative 
You're spelling out your love 
You shouldn't be alone in there 
You could be above ground 

If you're frustated then go
If you're frustated then go

Honey bee, we should be through with this,
Your packaged eyes, your vicious lips
You could be young, but you're out of touch
If this love's been done, then what's your rush?

I'm a specialist in hope and I'm registered to vote
Why don't you come into my barrio we'll see if you can float
I'm a specialist in hope and I'm registered to vote
Why don't you come into my barrio we'll see if you can float
