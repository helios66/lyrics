I'll make you forget with the taste of lambskin
The bounty is yours, it tastes like medicine
We evaporate without condensation
But heaven is still, your only expectation

I'll make you forget with the taste of lambskin
The bounty is yours, it tastes like medicine
We evaporate without condensation
But heaven is still, your only expectation
