To Nyarlathotep must all things be told.
For he is the messenger between the spheres, and the traveller between the realms of the living and the dead.
He shall summon forth the Ancient Ones and wake them from their deathless slumber. Then shall the elder signs be shattered and the Lords of Darkness be released.
