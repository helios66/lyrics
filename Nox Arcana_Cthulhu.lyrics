Hail mighty Cthulhu, high priest of the Great Old Ones. For when the stars come right, he shall rise from his ancient tomb to signal their return. Then shall the Ancient Ones, long ago banished to the outer spheres, break free from their prisons and plunge from the stars to claim the Earth once more. For those who lurk at the threshold of our world are ever vigilant for the time of their return.
