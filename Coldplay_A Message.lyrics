My song is love
Love to the loveless shown
And it goes on
You don't have to be alone

Your heavy heart
Is made of stone
And it's so hard to see you clearly
You don't have to be on your own
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not going to take it back
And I'm not going to say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
And I get that message home

My song is love
My song is love unknown
But I'm on fire for you clearly
You don't have to be alone
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not going to take it back
And I'm not going to say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
And I'm nothing on my own
Got to get that message home

And I'm not going to stand and wait
Not going to leave it until it's much too late
On a platform I'm going to stand and say
That I'm nothing on my own
And I love you, please come home

My song is love, is love unknown
And I've got to get that message home
