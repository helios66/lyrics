Tonight
We don't have a lot to go on
But that's not how it lives in my head
No, not at all
Blind times
Thought we were matching weight
We pulled
Sometimes it was you and sometimes it was me
But where are we
You say &quot;don't take it all so hard for now
There's so much space
And there will always be later for that&quot;
