Next to your chest like a locket
I own my brain in your pocket
You've got it in your hand everywhere you go
Up close to your mouth when your voice is low
You think how if I ever get busted
By another mean or matter what the cost is
We're inseparable, disconnectable
Without me you never go too far

I just wanna be your telephone
Keep me on
24/7 365 days
Think about all the time we could waste
I just wanna be your telephone
Never let me go
I know every dirty secret that you keep
Crazy as shit that no-one sees

Doo Do Do doo doo doo
Doo Do Do Doo Doo
Doo Do Do doo doo doo
Doo Do Do Doo Doo

Never would have to be jealous
When you're talking to all of those fellas
Cos I'm the only one that's ever gonna be
So well acquainted with y'all don't matter me
Like a shoulder to cry on
I'm the one thing you rely on
It's like a drug
I'm so in love
Never let anyone break us up

I just wanna be your telephone
Keep me on
24, 73, 65 days
Think about all the time we could waste
I just wanna be your telephone
Never let me go
I know every dirty secret that you keep
Crazy as shit that no-one sees

Doo Do Do doo doo doo
Doo Do Do Doo Doo
Doo Do Do doo doo doo
Doo Do Do Doo Doo

So here comes the comma,
Guess a better summer
I'll never be what you need
Cos you love that toy
More than this boy

Charge me on, turn me on
I love it when you use me
All night long

Charge me on, turn me on
I love it when you use me
All night long

Charge me on, turn me on
I love it when you use me
All night long
Charge me on, turn me on
I love it when you use me
Use me

I just wanna be your telephone
Keep me on
24/7 365 days
Think about all the time we could waste
I just wanna be your telephone
Never let me go
I know every dirty secret that you keep
Crazy as shit that no-one sees

I just wanna be your telephone oo oo
Doo Do Do doo doo doo
Doo Do Do Doo Doo
I just wanna be your telephone oo oo
Doo Do Do doo doo doo
Doo Do Do Doo Doo
Charge me on, turn me on
I love it when you use me all night long.
