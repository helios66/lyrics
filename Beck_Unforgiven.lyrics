Drive to the night
Far as it goes
Away from the daylight
Into the afterglow

Somewhere unforgiven
Time will wait for you

Down on the street
Just let the engine run
'Til there's nothing left
Except the damage done

Somewhere unforgiven
I will wait for you

Somewhere unforgiven
Time will wait for you

Somewhere unforgiven
I will wait for you
