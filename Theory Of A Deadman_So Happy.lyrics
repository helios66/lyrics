Put the bottle down, finally got somethin' to say
Take another look around and find someone else to play
(Needless to say) That you've got problems
(There's no fuckin' way) that I'm gonna solve them
(It's never the same) Every time you slip, then you fall down, down, down

Ever wonder what I've been thinkin' about?
I been thinkin' 'bout throwin' you out

I'm so happy about you (I'm fed up, so get up and get out)
I'm so happy now we're through (I'm fed up, so get up and get out)
I was so afraid, now you're gone away
Sent you packin', look who's laughin' now
I'm so happy that I feel this way
I'm so happy that I threw you away

Put your problems down and pick up what's left of the pain
Take a good look at yourself and see who's really to blame
(Needless to say) You've got issues
(There's no fuckin' way) That I'm gonna fix you
(It's never the same) Ever since you went fallin' down, down, down

Ever wonder what I've been thinkin' about?
I been thinkin' 'bout throwin' you out

I'm so happy about you (I'm fed up, so get up and get out)
I'm so happy now we're through (I'm fed up, so get up and get out)
I was so afraid, now you're gone away
Sent you packin', look who's laughin' now
I'm so happy that I feel this way
I'm so happy that I threw you away

I'm so happy about you (I'm fed up, so get up and get out)
I'm so happy now we're through (I'm fed up, so get up and get out)
I was so afraid, now you're gone away
Sent you packin', look who's laughin' now
I'm so happy that I feel this way
I'm so happy that I threw you away
