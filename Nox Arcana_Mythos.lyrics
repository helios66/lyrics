Long before mankind existed, the Old Ones trod upon the Earth.
They worshiped the Elder Gods and served them as slaves, but in time, the Old Ones gained the knowledge of dark magic and dared to use their sinister powers against their masters.
The wrath of the Elder Gods was merciless and terrible, and those who rebelled against them were banished to distant dimensions and imprisoned deep within the darkest recesses of the Earth.
In deathless sleep, the Old Ones dream and lie in wait for the time when they shall rise again. For when the stars come right, they shall awaken from their aeon-old slumber. Then shall they return to hold dominion over our world once more, bringing woe and destruction unto mankind.
