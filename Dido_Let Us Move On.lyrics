Don’t wrap it up and go or hide it behind the sun
Just give it to me as it is
And let it stand
Don't fly it like a kite...between the clouds
It needs no excuse, just bring it down

Let us that are in pain look upon it
In all its glory
Let us move on, Let us move on
This is short and it will pass
Let us move on, Let us move on
For this is short, and it will pass

Every voice that is lifted
River and some pain
Show us now, and let love not be chained
We should feel what we can stop, let us be alive
Show enough, and we've done, now we can

Let us that are frozen get to see
In all its glory
Let us move on, Let us move on
For this is short and it will pass
Let us move on, Let us move on
For this is short, and it will pass

And let all that is lost be forgotten
And it will pass
So let all that is lost be forgotten
Let us move on

Like the waters and the open sea
With tribulation come over you say yes hopefully
And yesterday you could probably say there’s no hope for me
But today I’m overly dedicated
I’m posting via testimony for broken hearts in the city
You’re either crash landing or planning on flyin' with me
Misery love standing behind his company,
Well, vividly I could see that your feelings would like to dwell
On our past encounters, reaching over the counter
Told me that it’s appealing to ?op a pill less or down now
I heard emotions burn deep
I heard when you fall out of love, the drop is deep
I heard when you see a thug that’s what you try to be
Git these burdens under my wings but I’m still free
Cause I can make the decision to let it all go away
Before I ever run astray, I looked you in the eye and say

Let us move on, Let us move on
For this is short and it will pass
Let us move on, Let us move on
For this is short, and it will pass

Let us move on, Let us move on
For this is short and it will pass
Let us move on, Let us move on
For this is short, and in the past
And in the past
