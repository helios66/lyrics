You're with someone else
Tomorrow night
Doesn't matter to me

'Cause as the sun dies
Into the hill
You got all I need

You pulled a blanket across my eyes
It's a tragedy
Take a lonely look, from my sake
It's a tragedy

Oh country air
Is good for me
No matter who's side I'm on

Like these dead leaves
Dried in the sun
I'll be up and gone

There's a stranger at her side
Oh Lord
He's a wiser man than I
Oh Lord

I am a good man
By any count
And I see better things to come

Could she be right
When she repeats
I am the lucky one

You're one of us
Or one of them?
(x5) 

You're one of us
Or one of them?
