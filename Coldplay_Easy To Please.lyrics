Love, I hope we get old,
I hope we can find a way of seeing it all
Love, I hope we can be
I hope I can find a way of letting you see

That I'm so easy to please
So easy

Love, I hope we grow up
I hope we can find a way of seeing it all
Love, I hope we can be
I hope I can find a way of letting you see

That I'm so easy to please
So easy
